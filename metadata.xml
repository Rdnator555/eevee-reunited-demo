[h1]PLEASE READ BELOW![/h1]

(Be sure to uninstall the old AB+ Eevee! There will obviously be compatibility issues)

Eevee: Reunited is an overhaul project of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1809450880]Eevee Mod for Afterbirth+[/url]. This aims to reunite every Eeveelution back to Eevee as the original mod always meant to do, all with unique attacks, many unique Pokémon-themed items, and much more. This is a demo release that will slowly gain updates over time for the purpose of gaining support for the project, receiving feedback, and putting forward the quality you can expect for the full release. If you would like to follow development or directly contribute to the mod, join the Discord Server linked below. We're looking for spriters and artists, but coders are also welcome. Enjoy the mod!
